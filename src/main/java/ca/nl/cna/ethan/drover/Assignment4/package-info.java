Fibonacci Numbers
the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such
that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is:
And
The beginning of the sequence is thus: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
1) Write a class call FibonacciCalculator that does the following:
a. Has a method called isFibonacciNumber that determines whether an integer is in the
Fibonacci sequence
b. Has a method called getFibonacciNumber that returns the nth Fibonacci number. (Note
it takes in n as a parameter and calculates the number)

2) Create an application that does the following:
a. Determines and displays all the Fibonacci numbers less than a value input by the user
(i.e. print all Fibonacci numbers up to 1,000)
b. Prints n Fibonacci numbers (i.e. Print the first 25 Fibonacci numbers)
c. Checks to see if a number input by the user is a Fibonacci number (ie. Is 23 a Fibonacci
number?
d. Has a nice console interface to manage these options.
